The bottom line is that you will be using only the L1 GPS signal, which leaves you with ~15% of what would be available from a modern multi-GNSS unit. The sample rate - 30 seconds - limits what kind of reflectometry you can do. For the purposes of this homework, it restricts the RH to values less than ~10 meters."
